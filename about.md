  Hey there! This is Sebastian Fernandez's blog. I write about challenges and security, not a great writer, so not great stories but plenty of technical details. Currently working at Microsoft. Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.

I hack and program, enjoy breaking stuff and learning and writing in safe languages like F#, Ocaml and Rust.
